/*
 * Ordered along the buyer's journey on a game key store:
 *
 * 1. Trust    — is this shop legitimate? (TrustBar right under the hero)
 * 2. Browse   — which platform do I play on? (PlatformSection)
 * 3. Buy      — what is cheap, what is popular, what is new? (product rows)
 * 4. Learn    — how do I receive and activate a key? (HowItWorksSection)
 * 5. Engage   — news and media for returning visitors (blog, gallery, sidebar)
 *
 * No two neighbouring sections share a layout: the deals row spotlights one
 * title, the best sellers form a grid, the how-to breaks the run of products,
 * and the new releases scroll sideways. Each product row also answers a
 * different question, so the same titles do not keep resurfacing.
